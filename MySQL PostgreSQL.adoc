= Klaros Test Management
== Table of Contents

== Introduction

IMPORTANT: The Apache Derby database is only supported for testing purposes. Instructions for installing Klaros Test Management with Apache Derby can be found under (Still in progress).

Plan, control and document your entire test process with https://www.klaros-testmanagement.com/en_US/[Klaros Test Management] and integrate it seamlessly with leading tools for test automation, defect management and requirements management.

Klaros can be configured in a multitude of ways and reduces maintenance costs through reusable test procedures.

Manual and automated test cases are consolidated and evaluated collectively. Workload, progress and success of test activities can be tracked at any time.

You can checkout our demo version https://www.klaros-testmanagement.com/demo/pages/login.seam[here.]

https://www.docker.com/[Docker] is a free container-based software that allows a secure installation of applications on different operating systems such as Windows and Linux without a great deal of additional effort.

This installation documentation shows step by step how to install and configure Klaros Test Management under Docker for Windows and Linux.

The database systems: MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported by Klaros Test Management under Docker and are ready for production.
An adjustment of the configurations is described in the section "Configuring Docker Environment Variables".

You can find further information at https://www.docker.com/why-docker[Why-Docker] and https://www.klaros-testmanagement.com/en_US/[Klaros Test Management]

== Prerequisites

.Windows
[%collapsible]
====
The current hardware requirements and installation steps are described in the https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/[official Docker documentation.] The Docker Desktop installation requires a login.

To make it easier to update Klaros Test Management later, it is recommended to download the Dockerfile using Git from GitHub.
Git can be downloaded and installed from the https://git-scm.com[official site.]

During the installation you can select whether and how the line endings of files should be converted. Since the server is running on Linux inside the container, and the line endings differ from Windows (\r) and Linux (\n), we recommend to select the option "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings" or "Checkout as-is, commit as-is".

This completes the preparations for Windows. The chapter "Download the Dockerfile from Klaros Test Management via GitHub" describes how to use Git Bash to download the Dockerfile and prepare it for future updates.

.Git installation via Ubuntu/Debian:
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
----

.Git installation via CentOS/RHEL:
----
sudo yum check-update
sudo yum install git-core
----

The following command can be used to check whether the installation was successful:
----
git --version
Output: git version 2.20.1
----

This completes the preparations for Linux. The chapter "Installation" describes how the Dockerfile can be downloaded and prepared for future updates.

== Configuring Docker Environment Variables
.Configurable environment variables via .env
[options="header,footer"]
|=======================
|Variable                               |Description

|DATABASE_CONTAINER_NAME=klaros_db      |Database container name
|DATABASE_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd             |Database Password
|DATABASE_ROOT_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd        |[MySQL Only] Root password for the "root" user
|DATABASE_PORT=10001                    |Public Database Port
|KLAROS_CONTAINER_NAME=klaros_postgresql|Klaros Test Management Containername
|KLAROS_PORT=18080                      |Public Klaros Test Management Port
|TOMCAT_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd               |Password for login to 127.0.0.1:18080/monitoring

|MEMORY_MIN=128                         |Minimum available RAM in MB
|VOLUME_NAME=klaros-data                |The volume will be automatically created by Compose with the name "klaros-data" if it does not exist.
|=======================

.Modifiable variables after the first server start
[options="footer"]
|=======================
|DATABASE_CONTAINER_NAME=klaros_db
|DATABASE_PORT=10001
|KLAROS_CONTAINER_NAME=klaros_postgresql
|KLAROS_PORT=18080
|TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin
|MEMORY_MAX=786
|MEMORY_MIN=128
|VOLUME_NAME=klaros-data
|=======================

The environment variables can be configured and changed via the .env file.
For port forwarding only the ports "KLAROS_PORT" and "DATABASE_PORT" in the .env file have to be changed.

When creating the image, all blue marked values in table 1 can be changed before the first server start. After the server has been started for the first time, the values in table 2 can be changed as often as desired (restart required).

.Configuration via the .env file
The .env file is located in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file and can be opened with your preferred text editor.
----
vi .env
----

== Use older version
Since it is not possible to switch from a newer to an older version, a new installation of Klaros has to be created in order to use an older Klaros Test Management version.

All available Klaros Test Management versions for Docker can be found under https://github.com/klaros-testmanagement/klaros-docker/releases[GitHub.] 

After the Dockerfile has been downloaded via Git together with the configurations, a version list can be listed with "git tag" and selected as local branch via "git checkout".

----
git tag
git checkout tags/<tag_name> -b klaros
----

== Installation
=== Clone
Once you are in the directory you want, you can start downloading the Dockerfile.
----
git init
git clone https://github.com/klaros-testmanagement/klaros-docker 
----

With "ls" you can check whether the directory was created correctly.
----
ls
Output: klaros-docker
----

=== Build
The image is needed to create the Klaros container and start the server.

.PostgreSQL
----
cd ~/klaros-docker/PostgreSQL
docker-compose build
----

.MySQL
----
cd ~/klaros-docker/MySQL
docker-compose build
----

== Usage
=== How to start an instance
For the successful start of Klaros Test Management, two Docker-Containers are automatically created for the server and the database. The configurations can be found in the .env file.

.Starting the server
----
docker-compose up
----

[%collapsible]
====
.To execute the container in detached mode, the -d parameter must be added
----
docker-compose up -d
----

You can find further information in the https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/[Official Docker-Compose Documentation.]

After the server has been started, the message "Server startup in x ms" appears at the end. You can now use any browser to enter your IP address and port to access the Klaros website.

----
Username: admin
Password: admin
----

Example: 127.0.0.1:18080


====

=== How to start multiple instances

Another Klaros instance can be used to check backups for completeness or to test a newer Klaros version.
To start an independent Klaros instance, some configuration must be done. In order to save your existing configurations, it is recommended to create single instances in separate file paths.

.PostgreSQL
[%collapsible]
====
Copy the directory under a different name.
----
cp -r PostgreSQL/ PostgreSQL2
----

Open the .env file with your preferred text editor. Under Windows Notepad++ can be used as a text editor.
----
cd ~/klaros-docker/PostgreSQL2
vi .env
----
====

.MySQL
[%collapsible]
====
Copy the directory under a different name.

----
cp -r MySQL/  MySQL2
----

Open the .env file with your preferred text editor. Under Windows Notepad++ can be used as a text editor.

----
cd ~/klaros-docker/MySQL2
vi .env
----

====
//// In Arbeit ////
For a second instance to run independently of the first instance, the instances must differ in name, port, and volume.

=== How to shut down your instance
In detached mode, the server must be shut down via "docker-compose stop".
If the container has been started in the foreground, press CTRL + C to return to the terminal and shut down the container automatically. If this is not the case, the server must be shut down with "docker-compose stop".
----
docker-compose stop
