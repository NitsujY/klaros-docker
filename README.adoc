== Introduction
Plan, control and document your entire test process with Klaros Test Management and integrate it seamlessly with leading tools for test automation, defect management and requirements management.

Klaros can be configured in a multitude of ways and reduces maintenance costs through reusable test procedures.

Manual and automated test cases are consolidated and evaluated collectively. Workload, progress and success of test activities can be tracked at any time.

Docker is a free container-based software that allows a secure installation of applications on different operating systems such as Windows and Linux without a great deal of additional effort.

This installation documentation shows step-by-step how to install and configure Klaros Test Management under Docker for Windows and Linux.

The database systems: MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported by Klaros Test Management under Docker and are ready for production.

Instructions for installing Klaros Test Management with MySQL or PostgreSQL can be found at (Still in progress).

The Apache Derby database is supported for testing purposes. For configuration customization, refer to the "Configuring Docker Environment Variables" section.

== Prerequisites

.Windows
[%collapsible]
====

The current hardware requirements and installation steps are described in the https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/[official Docker documentation.] The Docker Desktop installation requires a login.

To make it easier to update Klaros Test Management later, it is recommended to download the Dockerfile using Git from GitHub.
Git can be downloaded and installed from the https://git-scm.com[official site.]

During the installation you can select whether and how the line endings of files should be converted. Since the server is running on Linux inside the container, and the line endings differ from Windows (\r) and Linux (\n), we recommend to select the option "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings" or "Checkout as-is, commit as-is".

This completes the preparations for Windows. The chapter "Download the Dockerfile from Klaros Test Management via GitHub" describes how to use Git Bash to download the Dockerfile and prepare it for future updates.

Under CentOS and RHEL, Podman is a popular alternative to Docker. Since Podman provides similar functions as Docker, the code sections with "docker" only need to be replaced by "podman".

Supported https://podman.io/getting-started/installation.html[Podman] version: 1.4.4

https://git-scm.com/[Git] is required to successfully download the Klaros Test Management Dockerfile from GitHub.


.Git installation via Ubuntu/Debian:
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
----

.Git installation via CentOS/RHEL:
----
sudo yum check-update
sudo yum install git-core
----


The following command can be used to check whether the installation was successful:
----
git --version
Output: git version 2.20.1
----

This completes the preparations for Linux. The chapter "Download the Dockerfile from Klaros Test Management via GitHub" describes how the Dockerfile can be downloaded and prepared for future updates.

== Installation
=== Clone
Once you are in the directory you want, you can start downloading the Dockerfile.
----
git init
git clone https://github.com/klaros-testmanagement/klaros-docker 
----

With "ls" you can check whether the directory was created correctly.
----
ls
Output: klaros-docker
----

=== Build
The image is needed to create the Klaros container and start the server. +
Windows users are switching from Git Bash to Powershell.

----
cd ~/klaros-docker/ApacheDerby
docker build -t klaros .
----

== Usage
=== How to start an instance
For the successful start of Klaros Test Management, a Docker-Container with the name "Klaros" will be created. The port marked in blue can be changed if necessary.

Warning: An anonymous volume is created when the container is created. If a named volume is desired, then -v must be added as an additional parameter.

.One-time execution: Create a Klaros container (anonymous volume)
----
docker create --name Klaros -p 18080:18080 klaros
----

.One-time execution: Create a Klaros container (named volume)
----
docker create --name Klaros -p 18080:18080 -v klaros-data:/data klaros
----

.Once the container has been created, the server can be booted with "docker start".
----
docker start -a Klaros
----

.To execute the container in detached mode, the -a parameter must be removed.
----
docker start Klaros
----

You can find further information in the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start/[Official Docker Documentation.]

After the server has been started, the message "Server startup in x ms" appears at the end. You can now use any browser to enter your IP address and port to access the Klaros website.

Example: 127.0.0.1:18080

It is also possible to create a second instance of Klaros via another port with its own database.
